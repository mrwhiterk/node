//Problem: We need a simple way to look at a user's badgecount and js points from a web browser
//Solution: Use Node.js to perform the profile look ups and serve our template via HTTP

//1. Create a web server
//2. Handle HTTP route GET / and POST / i.e. Home
    //if url === "/" && GET
        //show search
    //if url== "/" && POST
        //redirect to /:username

//3. Handle HTTP route GET /:username i.e. /chalkers
    //if url == "/...."
        //get json from Treehouse
            //on "end"
                //show profile
            //on "error"
                //show error
//4. Function that handles the reading of files and merge in values
    // read from file and get a string
        // merge values into string
